# Pokémon Type Chart - UI/UX Improvements & Functionality Verification

## Summary
This document outlines the improvements made to streamline the UI and verify core functionality of the Pokémon Type Chart app.

## Changes Made

| > 900px (Desktop) | 6 | 3 rows × 6 columns |
| > 600px (Tablet landscape) | 6 | 3 rows × 6 columns |
| > 400px (Mobile/Tablet portrait) | 3 | 6 rows × 3 columns |
| ≤ 400px (Small mobile) | 2 | 9 rows × 2 columns |

**Key Benefits**:

### 4. **Code Quality Improvements** ✅
- Fixed all linting warnings
- Updated to modern Flutter best practices
- Code passes `flutter analyze` with zero issues
- All imports properly organized

## Core Functionality Verification

### Test Suite Created ✅

#### Type System Tests (14 tests)
1. ✅ All 18 Pokémon types loaded correctly
2. ✅ Types have proper structure (emoji, color, name)
3. ✅ Fire vs Grass = ×2 (super effective)
4. ✅ Water vs Fire = ×2 (super effective)
5. ✅ Electric vs Ground = ×0 (immune)
6. ✅ Normal vs Rock = ×0.5 (not very effective)
7. ✅ Dual-type calculations (Rock vs Fire/Flying = ×4)
8. ✅ Selection clearing works correctly
9. ✅ Defender toggle (max 2 defenders enforced)
10. ✅ Defensive multipliers calculation for all types
11. ✅ getTypeById returns correct type
12. ✅ getTypeById handles invalid IDs gracefully
13. ✅ Normal effectiveness = ×1
14. ✅ Ghost immune to Normal = ×0

#### Data Model Tests (5 tests)
15. ✅ EffectivenessMatrix handles missing entries (defaults to ×1)
16. ✅ PokemonType fromJson parsing
17. ✅ PokemonType toJson serialization
18. ✅ PokemonType handles missing optional fields
19. ✅ App loads and displays main screen

### Test Results ✅
