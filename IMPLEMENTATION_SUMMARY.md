✅ Coverage gap identification
✅ Visual stat chips with color coding
✅ Type selection with icons and dropdowns

### Type Coverage Analysis Features
✅ Type ranking system with scores

   - Defensive (best defensive types)
   - Balanced (overall best)
✅ Ranking visualization with medals (top 3)

✅ Floating action buttons for quick access
✅ Proper navigation flow
✅ Modal bottom sheet for type details

## Technical Architecture

### Design Patterns
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Provider State Management**: Reactive UI with ChangeNotifier
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Reusable widgets

### State Management
- `TeamBuilderViewModel`: Team state and analysis
- `TypeChartViewModel`: Type data and effectiveness matrix (existing)
- `ThemeViewModel`: Dark mode state
- Shared state via MultiProvider

### Key Algorithms

#### Team Analysis Algorithm
```
For each attacking type:
  For each team member:
    Calculate defensive multiplier (considering dual types)
    Categorize as weakness, resistance, or immunity
  Count affected members per type
Identify critical weaknesses (3+ members)
Identify coverage gaps (no resistances)
```

#### Type Coverage Scoring
```
Offensive Score = 
  (super_effective_count × 2) - 
  (not_effective_count) - 
  (no_effect_count × 2)

Defensive Score = 
  (resistance_count) + 
  (immunity_count × 2) - 
  (weakness_count × 2)

Balanced Score = (Offensive + Defensive) / 2
```

### UI/UX Design
- **Material Design 3**: Modern, cohesive look
- **Color-coded Stats**: Red (weak), Green (resist), Grey (immune)
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on various screen sizes
- **Intuitive Icons**: Group, Analytics, Shield, Flash
- **Modal Sheets**: Non-intrusive detail views
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental data loss

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Static Analysis
✅ `flutter analyze` - No issues found
✅ All imports resolved correctly
✅ No deprecated API warnings
✅ Type-safe implementation

### Build Verification
✅ Successfully builds APK
✅ No runtime errors detected
✅ All dependencies satisfied
✅ Asset references verified

### Code Quality
✅ Consistent naming conventions
✅ Proper null safety
✅ Clean code structure
✅ Reusable helper methods
✅ Commented where needed

## User Experience Enhancements

### Discoverability
- Multiple navigation paths (drawer, FABs)
- Clear labels and tooltips
- Intuitive icons

### Visual Feedback
- Loading states handled
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Color-coded stats for quick understanding
- Badge counters showing affected members

### Error Prevention
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Validation on type selection
- Clear disabled states

### Performance
- Efficient calculations (O(n²) for team analysis)
- Cached type data
- Minimal re-renders with Provider
- Lazy loading of detail views
